Polygons are protected territories in the world where you can build and store your items safely.

How to create a polygon:
1. Place a special block (diamond block or stone)
2. Fill out the form with the polygon name
3. The polygon will be created around the block

Polygon management:
• Use /polygon command to open the menu
• Add friends to your polygon
• Configure flags (permissions)
• Remove members when needed

Polygon flags:
• Break blocks - allow everyone to break
• Place blocks - allow everyone to build
• Open chests - access to containers

Important: Only the owner can delete the main polygon block!"""
